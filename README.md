### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently a student at @hivehelsinki, a school belonging to the 42 Network, and I'm also doing the FullStack Open course, designed by the University of Helsinki and the software company Houston Inc.

I'm learning C language, React and the basis of network and security

I'm currently working on sorting algorithms and how to best structure and collect various amount of data.
