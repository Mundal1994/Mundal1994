### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently a student at @hivehelsinki, a school belonging to the 42 Network, and I'm also doing the FullStack Open course, designed by the University of Helsinki and the software company Houston Inc.

I'm currently taking the cs50ai course and working on C++ projects from Hive. Afterwards I'm planning on doing Hive's docker project and finishing the FullStack Open course.

Hive: C language, C++, python, docker, basis of network and security.
  At Hive I focused on sorting algorithms and how to best structure and collect various amount of data.

FullStack Open: React, modern JavaScript based web programming, Node.js

CS50ai: python, artificial intelligense
